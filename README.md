In this study, 249 mice found to have SCC tumors were treated with various drugs. Tumor development was observed and measured over a period of 45 days. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' target drug, Capomulin, to other treatment regimens. 

- The average tumor volume has a strong linear correlation with mouse weight, as weight increases the average tumor volume increases
- Capomulin and Ramicane were found to be the most effective drug treatments
- Capomulin drug treatment has a unique behavior where the tumor volume increases first and then drops drastically
